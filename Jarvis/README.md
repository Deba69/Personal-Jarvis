# Jarvis: Python Voice Assistant

Jarvis is a modular, voice-activated desktop assistant inspired by the fictional AI from Iron Man. The goal is to create a Python-based assistant capable of executing natural language commands for tasks such as:

- Opening applications
- Controlling system settings
- Performing web automation

## Core Libraries
- [SpeechRecognition](https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/): For capturing and transcribing voice input
- [pyttsx3](https://pypi.org/project/pyttsx3/): For text-to-speech output
- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/): For exposing APIs and modular integration
- [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) / [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/): For natural language understanding

## Project Status
This is an initial project skeleton. Features will be developed incrementally. See the codebase and future updates for more details.
